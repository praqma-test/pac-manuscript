# PAC demo

## Prerequisites

- The demo requires docker, and the ability to run the `praqma/pac` container. 
- We use `bash` scripts. If you use a different shell you'll need to modify the script and your commands. 
- The demo requires a pre-loaded and booted instance of jira. You can start a pre-loaded test instance for jira by cloning [PAC](https://github.com/Praqma/Praqmatic-Automated-Changelog). And executing the following command from the root of the repository: `./test/resources/start_task_system.sh "jira"` 


## Manuscript

First clone this repositoy. Clone it to your home folder: `git clone git@github.com:praqma-test/pac-manuscript.git`

The demo works by you checking out each of those commits, one at at time starting with the first commit: 

`git checkout 63dc6e2`...one at a time....until...`35a662b` 

```
35a662b FAS-2 Added debug. This should also output data found in FAS-1
68fac9f FAS-1 Demonstrating basic jira integration
6ac3e59 TODO-1 Demonstrate how to use labels
c215709 PAC-3 Add pdf output
df2b682 PAC-2 Added HTML report
57329dd PAC-1 Updated minimal templates to include commits as well
63dc6e2 PAC-1 Intial commit
``` 

And for each checkout running this command:

`docker run --rm --net=host -v ~/pac-manuscript:/data praqma/pac:2.0.0-4 -d 2013-01-01 --settings=/data/pac_settings.yml`

Each commit will gradually introduce a new feature for PAC, and you can observe the output generated by inspecting either of these files:

- html-minimal.html
- html-minimal.pdf
- jira.md
- minimal-report.md
